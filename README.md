# linux-deepdive
This is a repository containing notes and sample code for my ongoing research into UNIX/Linux.

## Structure
This repository will have the following structure:
- Root
  - Notes
  - Projects

### Notes
The *Notes* section will contain a series of markdown files each one named for the topic covered.

### Projects
The *Projects* section will contain various small projects and bits of code used as demonstration. The directory structure will group one directory per project with each project having any sub-directories as needed.
